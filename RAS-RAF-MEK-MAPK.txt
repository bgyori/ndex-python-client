Evidence: VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 mRNA was identified in a number of breast cancer cell lines including T-47D, MCF7, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-231, and these cancer cells were shown to respond to VEGF.85,86 VEGF stimulation increased the invasiveness of T-47D cells in the presence of fibronectin.85 ERK-1 and -2 were activated in response to VEGF in T-47D cells; PI3-K and its downstream target Akt were also activated. Since T-47D cells secrete VEGF87 it is likely that an autocrine VEGF loop exists within these cells. PI3-K activation has often been implicated in cellular invasion88 and may be the signalling mechanism in T-47D cells that mediates VEGF-induced cell invasion.

ERK dominant negative construct reduced the uPA promoter expression greater than 24-fold. Further, expression of dominant negative vectors PC4raf, CL100, and K97M for the ERK pathway reduced uPA protein expression by 75%, 82% and 57% respectively. This indicates that in MAPK pathway ERK represent a significant component in the regulation of uPA.

RKIP Ser-153 phosphorylation by PKC either in vitro or in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or epidermal growth factor causes release of RKIP from Raf-1

It was also proved that the activation of MEK and MAPK takes place in a EGFR-dependent manner. These results indicate that cell adhesion through E-cadherin results in the activation of Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway.

Evidence: Using sequence-specific peptides, we found that the second proline-rich domain of DOC-2/DAB2 is the key binding site to Grb2 in the presence of growth factors. Such elevated binding interrupts the binding between SOS and Grb2, which consequently suppresses downstream ERK phosphorylation. Reduced ERK phosphorylation was restored when the binding between DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2 was interrupted by a specific peptide or by increasing the expression of Grb2.

Evidence: However, using an inhibitor of ERK activation, U0126, we show that Alb-AGE stimulates VEGF expression through an ERK-dependent pathway. Accordingly, we found that Alb-AGE activated mitogen-activate protein kinase, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, but not p38, and that Alb-AGE did not activate PI3K and PKB. Moreover, Alb-AGE activated the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) DNA binding activity. This activation is mediated by an increase in accumulation of the HIF-1alpha protein through an ERK-dependent pathway.

VEGF increased secreted MMP-1, MMP-3, and especially MMP-13, which could be effectively reduced by an inhibitor of VEGFR-2 kinase activity. Interestingly, VEGF diminished the expression of TIMP-1 and especially TIMP-2.

Evidence: Taurine-induced changes in the expression profiles of HepG2 cells were assessed using a cDNA microarray technology, and confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. Of 8,298 human genes on the microarray, 128 genes (87 known genes) were up-regulated, and 349 (206 known genes) were down-regulated more than 2.0-fold by taurine. Among the 293 known genes regulated by taurine, a total of 44 genes were involved in signal transduction; 16 genes were up-regulated greater than 2.0-fold, and 28 genes were down-regulated more than 2.0-fold by taurine. The results of RT-PCR analyses for the five genes selected were consistent with our microarray data, although the fold changes in the expression level differed somewhat between the two analytical methods. Among signal transduction-related genes affected by taurine, four genes--mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase 7, p21-activated kinase 4, sprouty homolog 2, and MAPK kinase 1--are implicated in the MAPK signaling pathway. Taurine also regulated the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 gene involved in the Janus kinase-STAT pathway, and diacylglycerol kinase, zeta 104 kDa, the downstream mediator of the protein kinase C transmembrane signaling pathway. In conclusion, gene expression profiling of HepG2 cells treated with taurine provided us with new insights into the novel aspects of taurine as a possible regulator of MAPK signaling cascades and protein kinase C signaling pathways involved in cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

Evidence: Summary: Raf-1 is a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) which functions downstream of the Ras family of membrane associated GTPases to which it binds directly. Once activated Raf-1 can phosphorylate to activate the dual specificity protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2 which in turn phosphorylate to activate the serine/threonine specific protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2. Activated ERKs are pleiotropic effectors of cell physiology and play an important role in the control of gene expression involved in the cell division cycle, apoptosis, cell differentiation and cell migration.

Evidence: We show that in the human breast carcinoma T47D cells, upon estrogen treatment, p130Cas rapidly and transiently associates with the estrogen receptor alpha in a multi-molecular complex containing the c-Src kinase and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. Association of p130Cas with the estrogen receptor alpha occurs within 3 minutes of estrogen treatment and is dependent on c-Src kinase activation. Transient overexpression of p130Cas in T47D cells increases estrogen-dependent Src kinase and Erk1/2 MAPKs activities and accelerates their kinetics of stimulation.

Evidence: In brief, p210BCR/ABL activates signal transduction pathways such as RAS/MAPK, PI-3 kinase, c-CBL and CRKL pathways, JAK-STAT and the Src pathway. Of these, the ras, Jun-kinase, and PI-3 kinase pathways have been demonstrated to play a major role in transformation and proliferation (Raitano et al., 1995; Sawyers et al., 1995; Skorski et al., 1995, 1997a). Inhibition of apoptosis is thought to result from activation of the PI-3 kinase and RAS pathways, with induction through AKT of c-myc and BCL-2 (Raitano et al., 1995; Sawyers et al., 1995; Skorski et al., 1995, 1997a; Warmuth et al., 1999)

Evidence: When the Bcl-2 oncogene which mediates inhibition of apoptosis [52], was transfected into tumor cells, tumor cell apoptosis decreased and VEGF expression increased significantly [48]. In another study, human osteosarcoma cells implanted in mice formed only microscopic avascular, dormant tumors, in which tumor cell proliferation was balanced by tumor cell apoptosis. When these cells were transfected with the ras oncogene, VEGF expression doubled, expression of thrombospondin decreased significantly, and large neovascularized tumors grew within approximately 2 weeks [7]. Thus, targeting oncogene products not only affects cancer cell proliferation and cell death, but also disrupts production of angiogenic factors. These studies predict that certain anti-cancer drugs developed for their capacity to block an oncogene product (for example, inhibitors of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase), may have significant antiangiogenic activity [12,53,54]. For example, ras farnesyl transferase inhibitors block oncogene signaling pathways which up-regulate tumor cell production of VEGF and down-regulate production of the angiogenesis inhibitor, thrombospondin-1 [47].

Evidence: In c-MET-overexpressing SCLC cell line NCI-H69, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) dramatically induced c-MET phosphorylation at phosphoepitopes pY1230/1234/1235 (catalytic tyrosine kinase), pY1003 (juxtamembrane), and also of paxillin at pY31 (CRKL-binding site). We utilised a global proteomics phosphoantibody array approach to identify further c-MET/HGF signal transduction intermediates in SCLC. Strong HGF induction of specific phosphorylation sites in phosphoproteins involved in c-MET/HGF signal transduction was detected, namely adducin-alpha [S724], adducin-gamma [S662], CREB [S133], ERK1 [T185/Y187], ERK1/2 [T202/Y204], ERK2 [T185/Y187], MAPKK (MEK) 1/2 [S221/S225], MAPKK (MEK) 3/6 [S189/S207], RB [S612], RB1 [S780], JNK [T183/Y185], STAT3 [S727], focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [Y576/S722/S910], p38alpha-MAPK [T180/Y182], and AKT1[S473] and [T308]. Conversely, we also identified modest inhibition of phosphorylation
by HGF in the following phosphoproteins (Figures 2A and
B): PKCa [S657], PKCa/b [T368/641], and PKCd [T505]. Moreover,
HGF also inhibited phosphorylation of PKR [T451], which is
known to have antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic functions.
Lastly, HGF also reduced the threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation
of the cell cycle checkpoint regulator CDK1 [T14/Y15].

Evidence: we examined
the requirement for PKCs in the PMA-induced activation of
ERKs by using different PKC inhibitors. Treatment with
GF109203X resulted in a total inhibition of ERKs activation,
whereas rottlerin had no effect (Figure 8). Because rottlerin is
unable to block the activation of ERKs by PMA, PKC-d is
not implicated in this process. Given that atypical PKCs were not
activated by PMA on the XG-6 cells, these results suggest that
PKC-z was not involved...Finally, because XG-6 cells express
PKC-nu and PKC-d as novel PKC isoforms, we can assume that
the novel PKC, namely PCK-nu, is involved in the activation of
ERKs by PMA.

Evidence: from Gene MAP3K3:       This gene product is a 626-amino acid polypeptide that is 96.5% identical to mouse Mekk3. Its catalytic domain is closely related to those of several other kinases, including mouse Mekk2, tobacco NPK, and yeast Ste11. Northern blot analysis revealed a   4.6-kb transcript that appears to be ubiquitously expressed. This protein directly regulates the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathways by activating SEK and MEK1/2 respectively; it does not regulate the p38 pathway. In cotransfection assays, it enhanced transcription from a nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB)-dependent reporter gene, consistent with a role in the SAPK pathway. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.

Evidence: In addition, the constitutively active form of MAPKK (SDSE-MAPKK) suppressed Fas-mediated apoptosis, and MKP-1, a phosphatase specific for classical MAPK, canceled the protective activity of oncogenic K-Ras (K-RasV12), Raf-CAAX, and SDSE-MAPKK. Furthermore, physiological activation of Ras by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) protected Fas-transgenic Balb3T3 cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis. bFGF protection was also dependent on the activation of the MAPK pathway through Ras. All the results indicate that the activation of MAPK through Ras inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis in Balb3T3 cells, which may play a role in oncogenesis

The a-Raf activated by serum stimulation induced activation of MEK1, which is determined by the coupled kinase activity, and immunoprecipitation and yeast-two hybrid analysis showed that MEK1 is direct substrate of a-Raf.

These interactions link FAK to signaling pathways that modify the cytoskeleton and activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (Fig. 3A).

Endogenous MSK1 is activated in 293 cells by either growth factor/phorbol ester stimulation, or by exposure to UV radiation, and oxidative and chemical stress. The activation of MSK1 by growth factors/phorbol esters is prevented by PD 98059, which suppresses activation of the MAPK cascade, while the activation of MSK1 by stress stimuli is prevented by SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of SAPK2/p38. The activated MSK1 translocates to nucleus and activates CREB by phosphorylating at serine 133.

Evidence: ERK phosphorylation that was constitutive in mutant
ras MM cells was completely abolished by the MEK inhibitor
PD98059 (Figure 2C, left panels), as was the ERK phosphorylation
reinduced in wild-type cells by readdition of IL-6 (Figure 2C, right

could reinduce AKT phosphorylation in wild-type cells in a
wortmannin-sensitive fashion. Moreover, the constitutively maintained
AKT phosphorylation in the mutation-containing cells was
also sensitive to wortmannin. These data indicate the PI3-K/AKT
cascade is a ras effector in these mutant ras–containing MM cells.

Evidence: To test whether p70 phosphorylation is mediated by mTOR, we used the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. As shown (Figure 4C), it inhibited phosphorylation at Thr389 as well as Thr421/Ser424, indicating that ras-dependent ERK and/or PI3-K-induced signaling must flow through mTOR for p70S6K phosphorylation.

Evidence: Together, the results suggest that 14-3-3 binds both PKC-zeta (at phospho-Ser-186) and Raf-1 in a ternary complex. Phosphorylation of 14-3-3beta by PKC-zeta negatively regulated their physical association. 14-3-3beta with its putative PKC-zeta phosphorylation sites mutated enhanced co-precipitation between PKC-zeta and Raf-1, suggesting that phosphorylation of 14-3-3 by PKC-zeta weakens the complex in vivo. We conclude that 14-3-3 facilitates coupling of PKC-zeta to Raf-1 in an isotype-specific and phosphorylation-dependent manner. We suggest that 14-3-3 is a transient mediator of Raf-1 phosphorylation and activation by PKC-zeta.

Evidence: Advances in differentiation therapy of cancer are likely to depend on improved understanding of molecular events that underlie cell differentiation. We reported recently that cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)5 and p35Nck5a (p35) are expressed in human leukemia HL60 cells induced to differentiate to monocytes by an exposure to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D(3)), form a complex, and this complex has kinase activity (F. Chen and G. P. Studzinski, Blood 2001;97:3763). This laboratory has also provided evidence that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is active in the early (24-48 h) stages of HL60 cell differentiation induced by 1,25D(3) but declines in the later, terminal phase of this form of differentiation (X. Wang and G. P. Studzinski, J Cell Biochem 2001;80:471). We examine now the hypothesis that Egr1 protein contributes to the up-regulation of p35 gene transcription and, thus, activated Cdk5/p35 kinase phosphorylates and inactivates mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1). Our data show that in 1,25D(3)-treated cells, p35 and Egr1 protein levels are elevated in a dose-dependent manner at the onset of the late stage of differentiation. We show also that 1,25D(3) treatment of HL60 cells markedly increases the binding of Egr1 to an element in the p35 gene promoter, whereas transfection of an excess of this Egr1-binding oligonucleotide ( promoter decoy ) reduces p35 gene transcription and cell differentiation. Additionally, Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates MEK1 and inhibits its ability to phosphorylate its downstream target Erk2. These data suggest that in 1,25D(3)-treated HL60 cells, Egr1 up-regulates p35 gene transcription and that Cdk5/p35 kinase inactivates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by phosphorylation of MEK1, and this contributes to terminal differentiation of these cells. We examine now the hypothesis that Egr1 protein contributes to the up-regulation of p35 gene transcription and, thus, activated Cdk5/p35 kinase phosphorylates and inactivates mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1).

Compared with wild type cells, ERK activation was decreased in Y542F- or Y580F-infected cells in response to fibroblast growth factor and PDGF but not the epidermal growth factor.

Evidence: We thus investigated the effect of OA, an inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, on ERK2 phosphorylation. In conditions of platelet aggregation, a dose-dependent increase in ERK2 activity was observed in the presence of various concentrations of OA (0?200 nM), with activity reaching 534%±144% (P<0.05) at a concentration of 200 nM (Fig. 2A,E). Moreover, using an anti-T183P antibody, we showed that OA increased ERK2 phosphorylation by 400±133% (P<0.05) at OA concentrations of 200 nM (Fig. 2B,E). In contrast, in the presence of RGDS peptide, in conditions in which ?llb?3 was not engaged, no statistically significant variation in ERK2 activity or in levels of the phosphothreonine form of ERK2 (even at 200 nM OA) was observed ( Fig. 2A,B,F). Surprisingly, increasing the concentration of OA decreased the level of phosphorylation of the Y185 residue of ERK2 (halved at 200 nM OA) in the presence or absence of RGDS peptide (Fig. 2C,E,F).

Evidence: DOC-2/DAB2 and DIP1/2 complex represent a negative feedback machinery for several exogenous stimuli-elicited signal cascade. PKC can phosphorylate the N-terminal domain of DOC-2/DAB2 (serine 24) that recruits DIP1/2 to inactivate Ras protein. On the other hand, shortly after the treatment of peptide growth factors, the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 (proline-rich domain) competes with SOS for Grb 2 binding, which leads to the inactivation of the MAP pathway.

Evidence: Treatment of melanoma cells with either TRAIL or U0126, a MEK inhibitor could not induce significant reduction in XIAP expression levels, but when the agents were combined there was marked decrease in the percentage of XIAP-positive cells, suggesting that TRAIL-induced XIAP was upregulated by ERK2.

Evidence: GST-DIP1/2 fusion protein containing the minimal Ras GAP domain (23), and either this fusion protein or GST protein was incubated with human recombinant [gamma -32P]GTP-bound Ha-Ras protein. The increasing amounts of GST-DIP1/2 (ranging from 0.2 to 1 Ã‚Âµg) stimulated Ras GTPase activity in a dose-dependent manner

Evidence: After activating Ras using EGF, the GTP-bound form of Ras was precipitated with GST-RBD (GST-Raf containing Ras binding domain). Precipitated Ras was detected using the HA-antibody. As shown in Fig. 5D, in the presence of EGF, the amount of GTP-bound Ras increased over that of the control. Levels of the GTP-bound Ras significantly decreased in cells expressing DIP1/2; however, DIP1/2m failed to stimulate Ras GTPase in cells treated with EGF.
